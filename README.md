# 🧠 Words Remembering Game

**Learn three new words a day — the smart and simple way.**

This is a minimalist word-learning game that helps you improve your vocabulary by requiring you to **write out the definitions** of three new words daily. It's not just about memorization — it's about **active recall**, which is proven to boost retention.

## 📌 How It Works

1. **Start your day**: Each session gives you **3 new words** to learn.
2. **Understand & write**: You type in your own definition for each word.
3. **Check & review**: Compare your definition with the actual one and reflect.
4. **Progress daily**: Repeat every day and build your word memory like a pro.
